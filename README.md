# A Fraymakers Collab Project - Framy

## Overview
A project dedicated to bringing Framy into Fraymakers as a full-fledged character! Complete with fully custom sprite artwork and a unique moveset. The current goal for Framy is a release around the end of 2025, and we need all the help we can get to make that a reality. A rough estimate of progress toward project completion as of now is about 21%. Animation and moveset information can be found below.
